__2. Data Transformation with Power BI Advanced Query Editor -__ Data transformation plays a pivotal role in data analysis. Using the advanced query editor, the dataset underwent necessary transformations, which included standardizing categories and addressing missing values. This transformed data is structured and optimized for analysis, forming a solid foundation for further insights.

__3. Power BI Health Dashboard Creation -__ Creating a comprehensive dashboard is a fundamental step in the methodology. Power BI, a powerful data visualization tool, was used for this purpose. The dashboard brings together various visualizations and key insights, making healthcare data accessible and user-friendly for professionals and researchers.
